# Scarcity Time Steps
Analysis of the correlation between scarcity timesteps in the load and the residual load.

# Use
Download or clone this gitub repository, e.g. to your desktop. Open a terminal and go to the dirctory where you donloaded the directory and start julia (usually by simply typing `julia` in your terminal or shell). Then:
```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.activate(".") # Make sure your in the directory where you downloaded this repository!
julia> Pkg.instantiate() # Will download all you packages
julia> using Pluto # Package for notebooks
julia> Pluto.run() # Will open a tab in your browser
```
From the Pluto browser tab, open `illustration.jl` located in this repository. The notebook may take sometime to load (2 - 5 minutes), so grab a coffee in the meantime. Enjoy!
